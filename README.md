## Open Zero Trust

Open Zero Trust is a Full Lifecycle Container Security platform, delivering end-to-end security for modern container infrastructures.

It offers a cloud-native Kubernetes security platform with end-to-end vulnerability management, automated CI/CD pipeline security, and comprehensive run-time security, including the container firewall to block zero days and other threats.

With the Open Zero Trust (OZT) platform, DevOps, DevSecOps, and Security teams have the tools they need to secure the entire container pipeline, from Build to Ship to Run, automatically.
